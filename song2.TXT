I dream of rain
I dream of gardens in the desert sand
I wake in vain
I dream of love as time runs through my hand
 
I dream of fire
Those dreams are tied to a horse that will never tire
And in the flames
Her shadows play in the shape of a man's desire

This desert rose
Each of her veils, a secret promise
This desert flower
No sweet perfume ever tortured me more than this
 
And as she turns
This way she moves in the logic of all my dreams
This fire burns
I realize that nothing's as it seems
